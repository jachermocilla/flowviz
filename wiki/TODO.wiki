  # Implement Catchment Derivation and Visualization Module
  # Randomize Iteration
  # Allow loading of appropriate tile based on lon and lat (assumes all tiles have been extracted in a data directory)
  # Perform K-Means clustering on sample runs
  # Fix the timing (assume 1 iteration as 1 second)
  # Specify as command line the dimension
  # Add the following layers:
    # Precipitation Layer
    # Infiltration Layer
    # Roughness Layer (Manning Value)
    # Capacity Layer
